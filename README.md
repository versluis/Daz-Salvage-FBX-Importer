# Daz Salvage FBX Importer
A proprietay FBX Importer for Daz Studio that works better/differenty than the built-in version as of 4.16.
It can import cameras, objects and materials often with better restults than the native importer can.
Animations are currently not supported.

This handy little tool was written by studets of Jeff Salvage's class as a year end project at Drexel University in 2022. 
I don't have the source code, only this pre-compiled binary I'm allowed to distribute to whoever wants to try this tool.

# Usage
Close Daz Studio
Copy the included DLL file into the plugins directory
Start Daz Studio and find an additional "Import FBX" option on the main menu
Use the new menu to open an FBX file and follow the instructions

# Future Development
Code from this project has been shared with the Daz Dev Team, who are actively working in imprioving the built-in Daz Studio FBX importer. 
The first version to include such improvements is Daz Studio 4.21.
Development is ongoing in the official open source FBX repo: https://github.com/daz3d/StudioFbxImporter
